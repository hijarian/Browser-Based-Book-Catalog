HTML+CSS+JS application for viewing and quering a catalog of books. 
Main feature and core design premise was that user should be able to use this 
catalog locally, without the web server. So, things like server-side scripting 
and AJAX are prohibited.

The books list itself maintained as the XML+XSLT document. To fill the list
a couple of Perl scripts was assembled, which translate plaintext description
into XML of catalog.

The catalog app lies in 'testbin' subfolder. 
To run open testbin/books-catalog.html in the web browser.
In 'paper' subfolder placed an article describing the project.

Demo data exists in the database. Basic interface designed and implemented.
Data importer from regular plaintext to XML developed.
Project is usable but somewhat ugly and not completely cross-browser compatible.


TODO:
1. Make data importers from CSV to XML.
2. Make interactive script for inserting data to database.
3. Make list of book categories dynamically generated. Now it is constantly
     defined in javascript (boo!).
4. Make code beautiful.

Estimated work: 30 hours.
Planned work period: January-February 2011.
